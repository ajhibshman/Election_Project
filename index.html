        <h2>Study Overview</h2>
        <p>2020 appears to have far exceeded voting rates in recent US presidential elections.  
            According to estimates on Wikipedia, 2020 voting among eligible population was between 66.4% and 72.1%.  
            If correct, this would be the highest turnout % since the election of 1900 (re-election of William McKinley). 
            At-least 22 million more votes were cast in 2020 vs. 2016 with an eligible population increase of only 
            approximately 9 million.</p>
        <p>For this study, I hypothesize that a states growth in population will positively correlate with an increase in 
            voter turnout rates.  Further, I hypothesize that given the outcome of the election an increase in a states turnout rate 
            should corrospond with a higher % voting democrat. </p>
